Robot Arm
=========
This is a project that currently emulates a human arm. An arm has 2 joints, one at the elbow and one at the shoulder. A simple  mapping to a robotic arm is by using servos to act as joints. 

Two servos are connected to specific digital pins of an Arduino Uno. When this code is executed, the servos will rotate in such a way that emulates moving an arm upwards in a half-circle.

##Future Improvements##
 - 3-D print a chassis for the arm
 - Add fingers
 - Add more degrees of freedom
 - Build a walking robot
 - Upload pictures for this readme
 - Many more...
